      <description>I co-founded HodHod Messenger, an instant messaging application, which was funded by four prominent VCs in Tehran, Iran. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m working as a Director of Product and Engineering at Ostadkar.pro, the largest online platform for home services in Iran. I spent about three years as a data engineer and scientist in the industry.
Previously, I received my M.Sc in Artificial Intelligence from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran. My research focused on Machine Learning, specifically Deep Learning.</description>
