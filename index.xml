In this part, I try to introduce some of the fundamental concepts of distributed systems along with their properties — moreover, a gentle introduction to MapReduce, and Apache YARN architecture.

I will assign a static IP address to each VM using netplan and change its hostname permanently. Moreover, I will set up a NAT and Host-Only networks for having internet access and ssh accessibility from the host.
